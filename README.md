# Mini-Alexa-Python
This project is a voice-controlled assistant built with Python. It uses speech recognition to take voice commands from the user and performs actions based on the command. The goal is to create a hands-free interface for performing basic tasks like opening applications, searching the web, telling the time, and more.
